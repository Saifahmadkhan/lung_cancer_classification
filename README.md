# lung_cancer_classification
This repository contains code of classification of lung cancer using symptoms and risk factors.
This is a data mining project which deals with predicting risk of lung cancer in patients using symptoms and risk factors as features.
I have used multiple models and ensemble techniques in this project.
Also I have experimented with multiple datasets and tried building a generalized single model for all the datasets.
